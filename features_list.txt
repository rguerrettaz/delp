Each entry in the list has the restaurant name, the number of stars and the location? How do we get location? Maybe seed the DB with a yelp call for 40 restaurants around our general area. 





MVP = 

pagination
UI - need stars to show on landing page, and on restaurant page
UI - clean the restaurant and landing page format
LANDING - Seed all tabs with some restaurants
PROFILE - make a simple profile page  (your reviews list)

Landing page with the tabs, really nice UI here
  - user lands on landing page, sees tabs with popular topics, the default tab is "All" The tabs are big letters and very obvious. Each tab shows the top 10 restaurants in that category.

sign-in popup on review page. 
Sign-in pop on create restaurant page??? Or allow anonymous creation for restaurants too. 
create default cohorts for user signup


Have add restaurant button from bottom of tab / list
Did i mention a clean ass UI? 
Database needs to be seeded with the most popular restaurants we have been to. 




DONE - search gem
DONE - be able to login and signup
DONE - "Review" button from the restaurant list in each category tab
DONE - Categories need to be seeded and working, they are set to default values like: (pizza, sushi, chinese, burgers, sandwhiches, mexican, other yummy goodness) Main topic is Food for now. 
DONE - Add restaurant button on home page. 
DONE - Have a nice UI with stars for rating. 
DONE- Be able to create a new restaurant and add it to a category
DONE - be able to post anonymously



Nice to have = 

carrierwave
the "other yummy goodness tab" has a dropdown in it where you can pick your category and we show you the results from it. 
Recommendations from yelp? (this is in the case that a category has less than optimal results.)
Add to my wishlist - must be logged in for this. 


Dreams = 

Google maps api would be dope to find the location of the restaurants. 
Would be cool to have a "discover random" button which runs the yelp api and returns a random 10, 4-5 star restaurants around your vicinity.
