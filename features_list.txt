Each entry in the list has the restaurant name, the number of stars and the location? How do we get location? Maybe seed the DB with a yelp call for 40 restaurants around our general area. 





MVP = 

pagination
search gem
Landing page with the tabs, really nice UI here
  - user lands on landing page, sees tabs with popular topics, the default tab is "All" The tabs are big letters and very obvious. Each tab shows the top 10 restaurants in that category.
"Review" button from the restaurant list in each category tab
DONE - be able to login and signup
create default cohorts for user signup
be able to post anonymously
Be able to create a new restaurant and add it to a category
Have a nice UI with stars for rating. 
No search function, just tabs. 
Add restaurant button on home page. 
Categories need to be seeded and working, they are set to default values like: (pizza, sushi, chinese, burgers, sandwhiches, mexican, other yummy goodness) Main topic is Food for now.  
Have add restaurant button from bottom of tab / list
Did i mention a clean ass UI? 
Database needs to be seeded with the most popular restaurants we have been to. 

Nice to have = 

carrierwave
the "other yummy goodness tab" has a dropdown in it where you can pick your category and we show you the results from it. 
Recommendations from yelp? (this is in the case that a category has less than optimal results.)
Add to my wishlist - must be logged in for this. 


Dreams = 

Google maps api would be dope to find the location of the restaurants. 
Would be cool to have a "discover random" button which runs the yelp api and returns a random 10, 4-5 star restaurants around your vicinity.
